The format of the paths-list file is as below (line wise) - 

=================================================
Standard implementation path
My implementation path
Output folder path
Your ouput filename
Standard ouput filename
--
All the cfglp options (one on each line)
--
Folder paths of all the input folders (one folder on each line, till the end of the file)
=================================================

Note that all the paths are to be given in the root format (i.e /home/user....).
Options are to given as -OPTIONS format, where OPTIONS are the possible options to cfglp.
There is no need to escape characterize the paths (no need to escape characterize spaces in the path).
